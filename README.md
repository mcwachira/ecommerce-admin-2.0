## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Control mulitple vendors / stores through this single CMS! (For example you can have a "Shoe store" and a "Laptop store" and a "Suit store", and our CMS will generate API routes for all of those individually!)
- Create, update and delete categories!
- Create, update and delete products!
- Upload multiple images for products, and change them whenever you want!
- Create, update and delete filters such as "Color" and "Size", and then match them in the "Product" creation form.
- Create, update and delete "Billboards" which are these big texts on top of the page. You will be able to attach them to a single category, or use them standalone (Our Admin generates API for all of those cases!)
- Search through all categories, products, sizes, colors, billboards with included pagination!
- Control which products are "featured" so they show on the homepage!
- See your orders, sales, etc.
- See graphs of your revenue etc.
- Create Orders
- Checkout using stripe
